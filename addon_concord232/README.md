# Concord232 Home Assistant App

Runs the concord232 server so the [Concord Alarm](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/concord/) integration can control your GE Concord 4 panel.

See **Configuration** in the app panel for serial device/URL and port. After starting, use the Concord Alarm integration with host `localhost` and port `5007` (or your configured port).
